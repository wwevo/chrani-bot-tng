                locations can have several different shapes.<br />
                you can have either a square or a round base, depending on your build-style<br />
                You can also limit the height of your locations, so you can build, for example,
                an underground base without affecting the ground above at all.<br />
                It is also useful for building multi-story builds with different locations per level,
                or even rooms on the same one.<br />
                This setting can be changed later on, at any time!
