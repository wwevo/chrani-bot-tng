# chrani-bot-tng
Flexible, modern, and easy to extend bot/webinterface for the game 7dtd

### *Important!*
`Do use the development branch for updates, testing for bleeding edge - master is rarely updated and only meant for stable (not necessarily usable ^^)`

### Vision
After running a gameserver for several years, and using several managers and bots, I have realized one thing: They
heavily modify the game-experience. In both ways, good or bad

While many of their features add elements and experiences to the game, they also take away from the core game itself.
Having teleports to move around, having protected stuff and areas, item shops...

The aim of this bot is to not alter the games experience by much, but only to add to it.
Specially for Admins/Moderators, and Builders. The casual player may not even notice that a bot is at work, apart
from the authentication process of course ^^

### Current state

* Module based functionality
* Monitor the games telnet-log
* Simple triggers to react to the telnet-log
  * player-join events are monitored to update playerdata during login/logout
  * commands can be entered into the games chat-widow and then parsed by tge bot
* Central Database with access triggers
* Socket/Push based webinterface that is triggered by changes to the database
* Widget system to easily extend the webinterface
* Multiple Servers can be managed with one bot (simplified for now)
* Epic **LCARS**-Style Interface :)
* Entities are being tracked (Players, Vehicles, Animals, Zombies)
  * Screamer protection can be activated for locations, all screamer will get killed after spawning 

* The following widgets are (partly) implemented
  * Telnet-log widget
  * Player-table widget (delete, login-status, info, kick)
  * Location widget (create, edit, delete, records time and place of death)
  * (Timed) Remote shutdown procedure
  * Simple gametime display
  * Entity widget
  * permissions widget to gate commands
    * a location can be designated as a Lobby to keep people in
    * a password can be used to authenticate a player, for example, to give them the ability to leave the Lobby 

  
### Future
Functions will gradually be added. One at a time

Next on the list is kicking and banning, which will require a framework for modal boxes. Which will then
also be used for deletion and other actions. Stuff like confirmation, or list of affected elements while
doing batch-processing and all that
