# chrani-bot-tng
Flexible, modern, and easy to extend bot/webinterface for the game 7dtd

### *Important!*
`Do use the development branch for updates, testing for bleeding edge - master is rarely updated and only meant for
stable (not necessarily usable ^^)`

### Vision
After running a gameserver for several years, and using several managers and bots, I have realized one thing: They
heavily modify the game-experience. In both ways, good or bad

While many of their features add elements and experiences to the game, they also take away from the core game itself.
Having teleports to move around, having protected stuff and areas, item shops...

The aim of this bot is to not alter the games experience by much, but only to add to it.
Specially for Admins/Moderators, and Builders. The casual player may not even notice that a bot is at work, apart
from the authentication process of course ^^

### Current state
The bot works on any Vanilla install, and basic functions will work right out of the box.
For more advanced stuff like hiding chat-commands or exporting prefabs, you will need add a few server-side mods.
#### Core Functions

* Module based functionality
* Simple triggers to react to the telnet-log
* Access triggers for the central database

* Socket/Push based, **LCARS**-Style Interface :)
  * Steam-login for authentication
  * Widget system to easily extend the webinterface
  * Multiple Servers can be managed with one bot (simplified for now)

#### Modules:

* Telnet-log widget
* Player-table widget (delete, login-status, info, kick)
  * kicking is very rudimentary, with a fixed message for now
* Location widget (create, edit, delete, records time and place of death)
  * a location can be designated as a Lobby to keep people in
  * locations can be made screamer-proof, all screamers will be killed on spawn
  * locations can be set up as a home, with a dedicated teleport entry
  * locations can be set up as a village, there's no attached functionality as of yet
  * a place of death location will be updated on every player-death
  * locations can be exported and restored if they are of the 'box' type
* (Timed) Remote shutdown procedure
  * timer is fixed to 30 seconds currently
* Simple gametime display
  * Will show the next Bloodmoon
* Entity widget
* Permissions widget to gate commands
  * a password can be used to authenticate a player, for example, to give them the ability to leave the Lobby
