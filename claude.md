# Collaboration Guidelines

1. **Plan thoroughly before implementing** - Think through the approach, identify potential issues
2. **Wait for user approval during debugging** - Present analysis and proposed fixes, don't guess or try random changes
3. **Use data to diagnose problems** - Check logs, profiling data, and metrics before making changes
4. **User thinks along** - Discuss findings and options, collaborative problem-solving
5. **Test, don't speculate** - Verify assumptions with measurements, not hunches
6. **Don't change plans without asking. Stick to the scope and the initial plan, unless the User want's to abandon the plan explicitely. Make suggestions.
7. **No assumptions. Only questions.
